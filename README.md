## Setup
We will all need Unity and Python 3 installed. As Unity is pretty much Windows-only, a Windows environment is preferred. We will use Git for the Python API/backend, and Unity Collab for the frontend. @Rafid I am putting you in charge of setting up a free Unity Collab team https://unity.com/unity/features/collaborate

If you plan on working on Python, make sure you have at least version 3 (done using `python --version`), and run the following commands:
```
pip install pandas numpy sklearn
```
Also make sure to read up on some basics of Scikit Learn if you're interested in working on the ML portion

I'll be using my past ML game as a reference, so feel free to look over the code (particularly, /modules/mlnetwork.py):
