# House Hunter
## Setup
We will all need Unity and Python 3 installed. As Unity is pretty much Windows-only, a Windows environment is preferred. We will use Git for the Python API/backend, and Unity Collab for the frontend. @Rafid I am putting you in charge of setting up a free Unity Collab team https://unity.com/unity/features/collaborate

If you plan on working on Python, make sure you have at least version 3 (done using `python --version`), and run the following commands:
```
pip install pandas numpy sklearn
```

## Knowledge

### Python/ML
I'll be using my past ML game as a reference, so feel free to look over the code (particularly, /modules/mlnetwork.py):

https://github.com/RyanAbraham/Uncharted-Realms-ML

We'll be using Scikit Learn for the ML, so read up on some basics if you're interested

### Unity
Get some basic understanding of Unity if you can. Once you install Unity, there should be an option to go through the basic interactive tutorial
